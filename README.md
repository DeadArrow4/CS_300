What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  I often struggled to understand Zybooks, I was able to understand the types of data structures that I have worked with before such as Vectors but when it came to understanding hash tables and binary trees I struggled.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I find myself often searching elsewhere for explainations on topics that I don't understand. YouTube is usually my go to for learning in more detail than zybooks is able to give me. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I tend to keep trying to solve a problem over and over again, which usually results in me stressing out about the problem. Once i realize this is happening I will take a break and come back to it, 99% of the time I find an answer rather quickly. This happened many a times trying to figure out binary trees.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I purposfully went with the binary tree as my data structure because I knew I struggled the most with it, So this project has opened my mind to the more complex side of coding and I figured out how to go about expanding my knowledge.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  before I even started my project I was thinking of ways to break down the program into smaller more manageable parts, It also helped that I had a plan documented in the form of psuedocode.
